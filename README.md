## API

### validate(origin: string, args: ValidateOptions[])

#### origin

Where the function is called from (human-readable string).

#### args

A list of arguments that define how the function accepts parameters.
> The argument is to be passed as an array, which is then deconstructed into the positional descriptors below.

---

### ValidateOptions as [name, value, types, options?]

| Argument           | Type                       | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | `string`                   | Name of the argument as a string literal.                                    |
| `value`            | `any`                      | The value of the argument as anything that the `types` and `options` accept. |
| `types`            | `string, object, function` | An array of type resolvers.                                                  |
| `options`          | `object?`                  | Argument options, can be omitted.                                            |
| `options.inverse`  | `boolean?`                 | Flip the condition state.                                                    |
| `options.rest`     | `boolean?`                 | Process the argument as an array.                                            |
| `options.optional` | `boolean?`                 | Make the argument not throw if it's null / undefined. Short hand check.      |

## API (Future)

*Remains to be said or written in stone. Support for decorators is on next major release.*

- `validate.one(origin: string, name: string, value: any, types: (string | object | () => boolean)[], options?: ValidateOptions)`
- `validate.arg(types: (string | object | () => boolean)[], options?: ValidateOptions)`

## Why?

Why not? Some code is designed to look like it shouldn't exist, but does anyway and works just as well. It was originally designed to be a simple 'private' method that would sit in a class structure or module without the need to use it elsewhere.

```js
const typeofAny = (target, ...types) => types.some(type => typeof target === type);

// first attempt did not include the options parameter
function validate(origin, args) {
  for (let [varName, value, anyof] of args) {
    if (!typeofAny(value, ...anyof)) {
      throw new TypeError(`${varName} (${value}) from ${origin} is not of any type ${anyof}`);
    }
  }
}
```

At the end of it all, this first working version probably took around 3 or 4 hours (including testing and minor patches).

## Credit

While I do like what I've accomplished here, it is still a joke in many ways and there are people I'd like to thank for supporting what I do or those who I look up to as inspiration.

- [@Koltonix](https://github.com/Koltonix) and [@Mistiare](https://github.com/Mistiare) for their guidance and support.
- [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) for continuing to provide the basis on how I, personally, should build my modules and projects (or at least a target to aim for).
